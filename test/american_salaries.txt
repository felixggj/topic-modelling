ABSTRACT
The National Institute of Health (NIH) sets postdoctoral (postdoc) trainee stipend levels that many
American institutions and investigators use as a basis for postdoc salaries. Although salary standards
are held constant across universities, the cost of living in those universities’ cities and towns vary
widely. Across non-postdoc jobs, more expensive cities pay workers higher wages that scale with
an increased cost of living. This work investigates the extent to which postdoc wages account for
cost-of-living differences. More than 27,000 postdoc salaries across all US universities are analyzed
alongside measures of regional differences in cost of living. We find that postdoc salaries do not
account for cost-of-living differences, in contrast with the broader labor market in the same cities and
towns. Despite a modest increase in income in high cost of living areas, real (cost of living adjusted)
postdoc salaries differ by 29% ($15k 2021 USD) between the least and most expensive areas. Cities
that produce greater numbers of tenure-track faculty relative to students such as Boston, New York,
and San Francisco are among the most impacted by this pay disparity. The postdoc pay gap is growing
and is well-positioned to incur a greater financial burden on economically disadvantaged groups and
contribute to faculty hiring disparities in women and racial minorities.

1 Introduction
American funding agencies typically do not account for geographic differences in cost of living when setting salary
standards. For example, the National Institute of Health (NIH), the largest biomedical research funding agency in
the US, sets a constant rate of pay for all postdocs awarded NRSA fellowships and restricts on how income can be
supplemented for fellows [1]. Although the NIH payscale does not restrict non-fellowship salaries, many US institutions
use NIH NRSA standards as a basis for their own postdoctoral salary levels.
The same salary can vary greatly in America across economic regions in terms of the goods and services (e.g. rent, food,
transportation) that it can be used to purchase. The US Bureau of Economic Activity (BEA) estimates this difference
across geographic regions as the Regional Price Parity (RPP) which is used as the basis of determining an individual’s
"real" income. Real income estimates the value of an individual’s income, adjusted by setting the value of dollars
constant across geographic regions using the RPP [2]. For example, the 2021 first-year postdoc NRSA stipend, set by
the NIH at $53,760, provides a real salary of $56,709 in Durham, North Carolina (RPP=94.8), and only $39,970 in San
Francisco (RPP=134.5).
Although larger cities are typically more expensive places to live, wages typically scale with the cost of living [3, 4].
This phenomenon is explained by the economic notion of spatial equilibrium, which predicts compensatory equality
between income, prices, and amenities [4, 5]. Because funding agencies set uniform postdoctoral salary standards
across institutions without respect to the cost of living, we hypothesize that spatial equilibrium will not hold for postdoc
salaries in the US, resulting in a salary disparity across American cities.

American postdoctoral salaries do not account for growing disparities in cost of living
Postdoc positions are generally considered to be a transitory period between training and finding a permanent academic
position [6]. The treatment of the postdoctoral career stage as a training period rather than long-term employment can
lead to a disregard for postdoctoral salary as an important factor in choosing a position [7, 8], despite the long-lasting
financial impacts of postdoctoral training [9]. The majority of tenure-track faculty at universities are trained by a small
minority of universities that are often located in America’s most expensive cities [10]. If higher-prestige universities
pay lower real salaries, a short-term loss in income could still be a valuable investment into future career outcomes.
However, a lower salary has the potential to disproportionately impact researchers who cannot absorb the short-term
impacts of a lower postdoc income, such as parents and individuals from disadvantaged socioeconomic roots.
This work explores how income differs between postdocs when factoring in the cost of living across geographical
regions. First, we find that, despite a modest increase in postdoc salaries in high cost of living areas, the value of a
postdoc’s income in the highest cost of living areas is 29% (15k 2021 dollars) lower than for postdocs living in the
lowest cost of living areas. This effect is not observed in the general job market, where income scales with the cost of
living. Second we find that the postdoc salary gap is particularly prominent in the cities and universities that produce
the most tenure-track faculty. Finally, we find that these pay disparities have likely increased with changes in the cost
of living across cities since the 1980s. Taken in context, these data provide indications for a source of inequity in the
academic pipeline.
2 Results
To compare salaries across institutions we use a dataset of 27,572 postdoctoral salaries acquired from H1B postdoctoral
hires between 2015 and 2020 reported by the US Department of Labor. We adjust salaries to their 2021 equivalent
for inflation across years to 2021 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of inflation. Although
departmental information was not available for every salary datapoint, the most commonly observed positions were in
biomedical disciplines.

(BEA) releases the Region Price Parity (RPP) across US geographical regions, which measures the difference in price
levels weighting rents, food, transportation, housing, recreation, education, medical, apparel, and other expenditures
(Fig 1). Using the RPP, the BEA estimates the Real Personal Income across the different geographical regions, which is
a price-adjusted regional income. We apply the same transformation to postdoc salaries for each university and salary
to estimate its real postdoc salary. Figure 1 shows the median postdoc salaries and median real postdoc salaries across
several statistical areas with large postdoc populations.
As a comparison to postdoc salaries and real salaries we look at the median salaries across all jobs in the same CBSA
reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Consistent with prior observations [3], we find that salary across
the job market scales with the cost of living, making real salary nearly constant (r(124)=0.04, p=0.63) across different
RPPs ((2A,B gray line). In contrast, postdoc salaries do not scale with the cost of living. While we see a modest
increase in postdoc salaries in the most expensive cities (Fig 2A blue line; e.g. 11% or $6,010 in San Francisco), real
postdoc salaries are negatively correlated with RPP (Fig 2B blue line; r(124)=-0.85, p=5.17e-35).

2.2 Top tenure-track faculty producing universities pay lower real salaries
Despite lower pay, there is a benefit to be gained by doing a postdoc in America’s most expensive cities. Where you
train has an outsized impact on your ability to find a tenure-track (TT) faculty position [10]. The prestige of PhD and
postdoc training institutions are among the strongest indicators of future positions [11, 10]. Faculty placements are also
increasingly dependent on fellowships and career development awards which are unevenly distributed across institutions
[12]. Clauset et al. [10], created a dataset of TT faculty in Business, Computer Science, and History, documenting the
universities where they received their PhD and found that just 25% of universities produce 71-86% of all tenure-track
(TT) faculty hires. Here, we use Clauset et al.’s dataset (faculty at US universities n=13,866) to observe the relationship
between postdoc wages, cost of living, and academic career prospects. Although this dataset reports data on PhD
training institutions, postdoc training institutions play a similar or greater role in TT career prospects in biological
sciences [11].
As can be seen in Fig 3A-D, we find that the American cities that produce the greatest number of TT faculty produce
a greater share of TT faculty than trainees, are generally more expensive places to live, and pay postdocs lower real
salaries. For example, the Boston metropolitan area produces the greatest share of TT faculty at 12% and only 6% of
PhD trainees. Boston has an RPP that is 115.5% of the American average and the real salary of the median postdoc in
the Boston area is only 93% of the American median.
The same trend holds true at the level of the University. Of the universities that produce the greatest ratio of TT faculty
to trainees (Fig 3E), those in higher cost of living cities pay a lower real salary than average (Fig 3F).
There are universities and cities that stand out. Chicago, for example, has an RPP only slightly above average (Fig
3A-D), and the University of Chicago, which produces the greatest ratio of faculty to PhDs, pays a greater real salary
than the median (Fig 3E-F). The same is true of schools like Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh, and Duke in Durham.

2.3 Cost of living disparity is increasing across universities
Cost-of-living disparities between cities are not new. However, the-cost-of living gaps between many cities with
large academic populations are increasing. In major university cities like Boston, San Francisco, and San Diego, the
emergence of tech and biotech industries have gentrified and increased housing prices throughout the 1990s, 2000s, and
2010s [13]. To measure changes in disparities in the cost of living across cities in comparison to postdoc salaries we
look at the Consumer Price Index and Fair Market Rents.
NIH salaries since the 1980s have fluctuated year-by-year but remain in a similar range to what they are today (Fig 4A).
Postdoc salaries bottomed out in the mid-1990s and then peaked in 2003, where a postdoc with 7+ years of experience
made a salary of $73,145 (2021 USD), in comparison with the salary of $65,282 in 2021. Over the past decade, postdoc
wages have been steadily rising, with the greatest salary gains for early trainees.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a weighted average of the prices of consumer goods like food, medical care, housing,
and transportation and is used as a measure of inflation. CPI measures changes in prices, but not absolute differences in
prices. The BLS has released CPI values relative to the prices of goods in 1982-1984 since 1984 across US economic
regions (Figure 4B). The cost of goods in regions like Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, and New York City have
raised relative to the national average over the past 40 years while cities like Houston and Chicago have seen decreases
in prices relative to the national average (Fig 4B).
The Fair Market Rents is a statistic published by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, measured as
the 40th percentile rents in metropolitan areas. Where CPI provides information about changes in prices, Fair Market
Rents provide information about differences in housing prices across economic regions, a major factor in the cost of
living and spatial equilibrium [4]. Differences in rent prices in these major metropolitan areas have increased since the
early 1980s (Fig 4C). For example, the monthly fair market rent of a 2-bedroom apartment in San Francisco was $1,430
2021 dollars in 1984 compared to $3,553 in 2021.
Taken together, postdoc salaries, as indicated by NIH standards, have fluctuated in the same range over the past four
decades. Meanwhile, cost-of-living disparities across many academic cities have grown.

and 2021. NIH salaries and Fair Market rents are inflated to 2021 and show the price of a 2-bedroom apartment.
3 Discussion
American postdoc salaries are held relatively stable across the United States despite differences in cost of living across
cities. These differences result in a lower real income for postdocs living in more expensive areas. In part this is by
design: the NIH sets standards on postdoc stipends that are held constant across the US. This pay disparity is increasing.
These differences in pay are reflected most strongly in the cities that produce the most TT faculty like Boston, San
Francisco, and New York. These same cities are becoming increasingly expensive relative to the rest of the United
States, resulting in a decrease in the real value of a postdoc’s income.
How do these pay differences impact the scientific landscape? Although substantial efforts have recently been put
into place to reduce inequalities in the opportunities available to American scientists [14], parity has not been reached,
particularly across race, gender, and socioeconomic background [15, 16]. For example, women account for over half
of US doctoral recipients in biology but comprise a much smaller proportion of the distribution of TT professors
[17, 18, 19, 20]. One factor impacting this disparity is an imbalance in the family-related responsibilities between
women and men [21] which can be exacerbated by financial hardship such as an inability to pay for increasingly costly
childcare [22]. The disparity between males and females in postdoc positions is greatest in laboratories that produce
the largest number of tenure track professors [23], which are largely located in cities like Boston, New York, and San
Francisco. It is unlikely that a reduction in income is the sole cause of the "leaky pipeline". However, decreased pay
during postdoctoral training and the downstream effects on parenthood and work-life balance may unequally influence
individuals who choose to pursue academic careers. Similar issues arise for those who enter the academic path with
college debt or without an available safety net allowing them to absorb short-term financial losses in order to pursue
long-term career benefits. For example, student loan debt is greater in black students than white students in America
[24]. These disparities do not fall in line with the NIH mission [14].

American postdoctoral salaries do not account for growing disparities in cost of living
Would anything be gained by the scientific community by paying commensurate salaries to postdocs in more expensive
cities? This question parallels one that pervades urban economics: why do businesses choose to locate in dense cities,
where they have to pay higher wages? It is believed that businesses choose to pay more for workers in dense areas
because proximity adds some degree of value through productivity [3]. It remains an open question whether or to what
extent proximity between universities in areas like Boston, New York, or San Francisco aid in research productivity.
Here, we do observe that many high cost of living cities produce larger numbers of TT faculty relative to trainees.
Spatial equilibrium predicts a compensatory balance between wages, prices, and amenities. The analyses here compared
wages and prices (e.g. rent, cost of living) but not amenities. Regions such as New England, the Pacific coast, and
the Mid Atlantic have more highly valued amenities than the rest of the US, meaning workers are willing to accept a
lower real wage to work there [4]. Still, our comparisons with non-postdoc salaries in the same cities show that postdoc
salaries do not scale to the same extent. For example, in 2021 the salary of the median elementary school teacher in San
Francisco was 70% greater than Durham/Chapel Hill, NC ($82,870 vs $48,620), while the median salary of a postdoc
in San Francisco was only 12% greater than in in Durham/Chapel Hill ($59,110 vs. $52,761).
Post-graduation, PhD students are faced with the decision to continue in the traditional academic trajectory or search
for employment in other sectors like industry or government. The pay disparity for postdocs driven by the cost of
living described in this work pales in comparison to pay disparities between postdocs and PhDs working in industry.
The yearly NSF Survey of Earned Doctorates reported in 2020 that the median life sciences PhD in their first year of
industry careers expects to make just over $100k USD, while the median postdoc expects to make half of that, only
$50k [17]. Within postdoc salaries, cost-of-living differences account for real salaries up to $10k USD greater or less
than the median real salary ($51,849), a difference of close to 20%.
Taken together, the data presented here provide new insights on the pay disparities between postdocs in different regions
of America and the direction those pay disparities have been moving over the past four decades. Salary differences
may also be present in income at other stages in the academic career such as graduate student stipends and early career
tenure-track researchers, where funding agencies also place caps on salaries. The consequences of these disparities are
unknown and warrant further exploration.
